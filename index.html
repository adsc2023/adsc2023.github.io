<h1>1st ACNS Workshop on Automated Methods and Data-driven Techniques in Symmetric-key Cryptanalysis (ADSC 2023)</h1>
<p> Over the years, many automated methods have been proposed to help designers and cryptanalysts prove security bounds of symmetric-key primitives against various attacks such as the differential or integral cryptanalysis. </p>

<p> These include the use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) solvers and their extension, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, as well as constraint programming (CP) solvers. </p>

<p> More recently, data-driven techniques that rely on machine and deep learning have also been proposed, leading to attacks that rival that of their classical counterparts. </p>

<p> The aim of the ADSC workshop is to provide an international forum for researchers to explore and further push the boundaries of these automated and data-driven methods. </p>

<p> We welcome submissions on the application, improvement and efficient implementation of these methods.</p>
